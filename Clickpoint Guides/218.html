		<section> Some men grow old, get fat, and indulge in the finer things in life like wine, golf, boating, and tennis. I've done my
			share of those things but my <em class="PTAG"></em> passion has always been women. Young women. Even women years younger than me are too old.
			I'm young at heart and I need a girl that can keep up. Are you that girl? Email me if you are. Experience is the most
			powerful love making tool. You wont regret it. ;-) </section>

				<p> I've never been a monogamous man and young girls certainly have no interest in being tied down. So I spend most of my
					day wandering the city stopping at all the usual spots for young college girls. Freshmen are the best because they are
					so eager to meet new people. Their guard is down and want to please everyone to make friends. It also means they have
					no one to turn to. </p>
				<p> I like to approach them and ask if they need any help finding their way around. Being an older man is actually disarming
					to them, they don't see me as a threatening figure at all and some have even said I remind them of their grandpa. I
					use that to my advantage to make them feel comfortable. I play the part they want me to play until I can slowly start
					to change the tone. It's amazing how many <a class="CPTAG">girls</a> who would normally tell you they aren't into old men start to feel comfortable
					(or uncomfortable) enough that they give in to my advances. </p>
				<p> Looking for young college girls means having more than one in a day is easy. Some girls have their first class free,
					I meet them, bring them back to my place and before they have any time to realize what my real intentions are, I've
					had my way with them and they are on their way back to class. Then another class of girls show up. Never overlapping
					in time with new girls who have no idea showing up here every year. </p>

				<p> The bookstore is a good place to meet girls. They are all looking to purchase their books for the semester and are full
					of questions. I make sure to know where all the books are located so I can help the young ladies find what they need
					and have a reason to follow them around and talk. </p>
				<p> This morning I spotted Kayla looking for an art history book. Her thick sweater hid some gorgeous curves underneath.
					I helped her find her book then asked if she was new to the area. She sat down with me and talked for a while about
					her classes and what she'd hope to do after school. She had warmed up to me and I started commenting on how pretty she
					was and how she reminded me of my daughter (I don't have one) which made her feel flattered but comfortable. So I started
					complimenting her more. Once on her intelligence, then on her looks, again on her intelligence so that things progressed
					harmlessly. </p>
				<p> Then I hinted at a great coffee shop near by and she suggested we go there so she could try it. I bought her coffee and
					we talked about her upcoming college life. I mentioned all the fun times I had partying and how I still enjoy that sort
					of life (letting her know that I'm still very active and fun) then I suggested playfully that if she ever needed alcohol,
					I'd be happy to provide it. Now she's interested. Alcohol to girls under 21 is the most powerful aphrodisiac. I said
					I had an extra bottle of whiskey at my <a class="CFTAG">apartment</a> if she wanted it for her dorm. I had implied she would make friends
					very fast if she had it. At that point her mind is on two things. Parties and drinking. Perfect. </p>
				<p> I get her to my apartment and tell her that I need to find the extra bottle and she is welcome to a drink while I look.
					She accepts because now she's comfortable with me and in a party mood. Once she has her drink I grab the bottle fast
					and sit down with her. She's not going to leave when she just started her drink ;-) I also pour one for myself which
					now means we are going to be <em class="PTAG"></em> here a bit which makes her a little uneasy but she's willing. To calm her down I offered
					to teach her a fun drinking game I used to play in my youth. She lights back up again because I've cut through the now
					sexual tension with more fun and made that tension comfortable by reminding her of my age. </p>
				<p> Now she's warm and needs to take off that thick sweater. I make a joke about stripping to bring the sexual tension back
					a bit. She giggles thanks to a few drinks and I start telling her how I'm blown away at what her sweater was hiding
					and she smiles uncomfortably but by now, I'm a sweet old man who has been so friendly. She's too polite to be uncomfortable
					for long. Kids are too worried about upsetting people these days. They'll do things they would never do just to make
					someone else feel better. She says she needs to go so I stand up to help her and start helping her gather her things
					but I brush up against her over and over. When it comes to the sweater, I hold it over her head like I'm dressing a
					child but slide my hands down her back and pull her in. She pulls away a bit but I'm strong and hold her close. She
					gives in and laughs an uncomfortable laugh but we've gone too far. I've started groping her and she's just confused
					enough and kind enough to let it happen. Before she knows it all her clothes are off and she's mine. </p>
				<p> She's too embarrassed to do anything other than enjoy it. </p>

			<div class="entry-content">
				<a class="CFTAG"><img src="Images/lick.jpg" class="pull-left pr" width="180"></a>
				<p> The bar is a perfect place to meet slightly older college girls or girls with fake IDs. I love girls with fake IDs. They
					want to always seem older so hanging out with an older man makes sense to them. They know we can buy them drinks and
					they wont be carded again and as always, we are non-threatening. I'm always sure to go to bars with my buddy Tom. When
					you approach a group of girls it's less pressure on everyone. No one person is being hit on. It's group to group. Which
					means, once they loosen up, they will start confirming with each other that things are fine. </p>
				<a class="CPTAG"><img src="Images/girl2.jpg" class="pull-right pl" width="300"></a>
				<p> As long as one girl is happy and drunk, they can all convince each other they are all happy. So we get to force ourselves
					through to the physical stuff much faster. Remember what I said about girls wanting to be polite? Well if one girl is
					even remotely ok with physical contact, the others will open up to it too. Tom did a good job of breaking the ice. </p>
				<p> I managed to get one girl to stay late, have another drink, and told her I could give her a ride home. We all know what
					that means... </p>

			<div class="entry-content">
				<p> Jackie is the very sexy girl that works the counter at my Pharmacy. I know she's caught me looking at her butt numerous
					times but she always meets my eyes with a smile. I'd love to slide those scrubs off over her juicy <a class="CFTAG">ass</a> and see what
					else she's hiding. I think she knows I get around. I'm always picking up antibiotics, cold sore medications, or special
					shampoo for crabs. That kind of thing. But that doesn't stop me from flirting with her. I always buy condoms when she's
					working the register and give her a wink. </p>
				<p> She laughs probably because she just shrugs me off as a dirty old man which people find endearing. You can get away with
					a lot when you're a senior <em class="PTAG"></em> citizen. When a girl doesn't even acknowledge you because she's "not into that" you can work
					your way in before she even has a chance to say no. They can't even imagine having sex with you so they aren't expecting
					it when you make your move. </p>

				<p> Not all girls are resistant. Some are just salivating for an older man. These are my favorite obviously. They not only
					are young and sexy but are eager to get the approval of their sexual performance from an older man. Daddy issues I guess.
					Who the fuck cares. They want to do it and please you badly. Those girls are saved for my slow days or when I've had
					a full day of golf and I just don't want to put in the effort. They tend to be a bit older (about mid to late twenties)
					but they are excited to have fun almost any time. </p>
				<p> Erica is one of those girls. She loves to make fun of my age but that's only because it turns her on so much. When I
					first met her I was at the gym lifting and she asked if my bones weren't too brittle for it. She said I looked so much
					like her dad that she was concerned. I said I could lift her no problem and she told me she'd like to test that. She's
					been flirting with me ever since and we get together at least once a week. She is always teasing me but I think she
					just wants to mention how old I am to herself as often as possible. I don't mind. </p>
