        <h1 class="text-center text-blueish mb">We are the sons and daughters of The <a class="CPTAG">Loogaroo</a> our beloved mother</h1>
        <p>We are silent watchers in the light of day. Invisible wraiths in the shade of night before you are taken.
            Our mother gives us strength and a tether to the throne of Lucifer.
        </p>
        <p>Our mother Loogaroo, loved by Satan, must shed her skin when the sun sets to wander our world in search of
            new blood to spill for his holy name <em class="PTAG"></em> before the sun rises again. Without her nightly gift of blood for the
            dark one, the devil will <a class="CFTAG">revoke</a> her power and reclaim the blood that is rightfully his from her being. We
            will not let our mother leave this world.
        </p>
        <p>We have long existed as the extensions of Loogaroo. Those who attempt to <a class="CPTAG">reveal</a> her skin and keep it for
            their own will suffer. We will wash clean the sands of your house. Our mother will not be denied what is
            rightfully hers. That is why we shoulder the burden of blood.
        </p>
        <p>One simple reason we are here, reaching out from the shadows. Sacrifice.</p>
        <a class="CPTAG"><img class="mt mb" src="Images/altar.png" width="800"></a>
        <p>We must please our mother and offer the blood of the living. We family of the children of Loogaroo must
            proliferate. Our arms are ever reaching. Join our <a class="CFTAG">family</a> and be saved. Bring us a sacrifice for our mother.
        </p>
        <p>Give yourself as sacrifice or bring us the worldly vessel of others. All <a class="CFTAG">sacrifices</a> must be alive. Mother's
            blood must be fresh.
