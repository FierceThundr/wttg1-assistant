			<p> The void of emotion within yourself. When mastered, you have become grey. When you have managed to shut yourself off from
				the emotions that pull us to <a class="CFTAG">irrationality</a> and can no longer be moved by others meaningless lives, you have emptied your
				center and may live in peace which, in turn, will give <em class="PTAG"></em> peace to others for eternity. </p>
			<p> When you can live your life removed from all. Numb to the zeitgeist of our world. You can begin to help others return
				the world to balance. You <a class="CFTAG">understand</a> that many can simply not live in the shade. When you are grey, you poses an ability
				others simply do not have. The ability to not be harmed. Invincible to the petty nothingness that is the lives of others.
				</p>
			<p> Their needs and wants no <a class="CPTAG">longer</a> hold meaning and the absence of their presence brings more <a class="CPTAG">balance</a> to your world and the
				world around you. When you understand that those within the hues of the dizzying world are simply selfish and feeding
				off of the life force of others, it is simple to remove them. </p>
			<p> Their lives do not <a class="CFTAG">belong</a> in the grey world. A world where all exist in peace where all can be who they truly are. Who
				you are. You are special. You are strong. You are in the shade that others can never enter. They will burn in the bright
				rays of emotion for their judgments <em class="PTAG"></em> upon others. Your house is built and they may never enter it's sacred walls. They
				will plead. They will scream. They will die as they are meant to die just as they are meant to live. Let them <a class="CPTAG">die</a> as
				they are no importance. </p>
			<p> Their lives are short. They provide no benefit to your world. They are a cancer for the peace of all and they will be
				removed. You and the many links in the chain of grey will pull them away from their selfish lives. When their is void
				there is peace. </p>
			<p> Go into the shade now. Your house is built. </p>
