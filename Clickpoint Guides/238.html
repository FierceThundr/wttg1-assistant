            <p>Warehouse 3 is currently inactive while the contamination crew <a class="CPTAG">finishes</a> their lockdown procedure.</p>
            <h4>Warehouses</h4>
            <p>There are 3 operational warehouses. Each can house up to 20 test subjects. But we can accommodate more
                if needed.

            <p>We conduct a wide range of experiments on human subjects at our facilities. The people chosen for these
                experiments are usually among the homeless, <em class="PTAG"></em> unregistered citizens, and we have recently secured a
                backchannel for obtaining members of various correctional systems. This allows us to spin up large
                scale tests very quickly.

            <p class="text-underline">Lab Work</p>
            <p>Laboratory examinations (full <a class="CPTAG">blood</a> counts, urinalysis, chemistries… etc) are done off-site at
                hospitals where we take the samples and <a class="CFTAG">send</a> them under other current patients’ names. The results are
                carefully dispersed so as not to arouse suspicion.
            </p>
            <p class="text-underline mtb">In cases of death</p>
            <p>The bodies of the dead are now cremated on site using Alkaline Hydrolysis at warehouse 4.</p>
            <p class="text-underline">Expedited trials and testing</p>
            <p>IRB approval is never sought for the <a class="CFTAG">experiments</a> performed at our facilities. Our ability to acquire
                test subjects at such a rapid rate allows the ability to spin up large scale testing quickly.
