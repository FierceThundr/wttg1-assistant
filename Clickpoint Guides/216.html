			<p> I believe you know who I am. I have made many slaves for your enjoyment and have added heavily to my own collection. If
				you do not know who I am, the answer is simple: I have found a very profitable business in taking pretty, young girls
				and transforming them into living sex dolls to fulfill all of your sexual and violent needs. They cannot escape. They
				cannot speak. You may abuse them however you like. They are now living toys and they are yours. </p>
			<p> My surgical approach to transforming young girls has changed slightly over the years. I believe my changes have made for
				an even more sturdy and obedient toy. I am very <em class="PTAG"></em> pleased with the girls I have kept for myself. The first improvement
				was that of the metal bars affixed to the Femur and Humerus after amputation. The metal bars would cause necrosis and
				subsequent porosis causing the bones to break. Limbs would break, tear, or even separate completely during rough sex
				or restraining/hanging the doll. Which was very disappointing as using her mouth while hanging over your bed is a very
				satisfying experience but very messy if the legs tear. However, I was very pleased that none of the dolls would scream
				in pain. Their mental conditioning to physical mistreatment has made them numb to abuse. Needless to say, I had to perform
				multiple operations to find a suitable solution. </p>
			<p> The process is much more involved and now takes place over four <a class="CFTAG">operations</a> to ensure survival and strength. It's very
				important all the girls are young and healthy so chances of recovery is higher. The first two operations are simple:
				amputate the legs, allow the girl to heal, then amputate the arms leaving the Femur and Humerus bones for attachment.
				It is important these are the first two operations not only because of the severity of them but this keeps the girl from
				being able to escape. The girl is kept heavily sedated throughout this period to not only make her easier to handle but
				the damage of being disoriented for months makes them very susceptible to mental abuse later. </p>
			<p> After a few weeks of care ensuring the <em class="PTAG"></em> legs and arms have healed enough, the girl will be put under again and placed on
				the operating table. Here, I will cut open her thighs down to the bone and all the way to the hip where I then affix
				a custom made marine grade steel rod with an eye hook welded to the end. This type of metal lessens the chance of necrosis
				and will be far more sturdy for constraints. The process is repeated a few weeks later for the arms with the incision
				going all the way to the shoulder. I make very clean cuts so scaring is minimal. </p>

			<p> This process takes several weeks and you have to take very good care of the wounds but the result is far superior. You
				can be as rough with her as you like. </p>
			<p> During the long period of time for the first operations, I started taking <a class="CFTAG">advantage</a> of the wait. I now perform the task
				of removing all of her teeth and implanting the silicone pads as it is not as taxing a procedure on her and she will
				recover. This allows her mouth to be used while her arms and legs heal. This has an added benefit of being distracting
				from the pain of the amputation and removing her teeth which begins the pain and pleasure confusion sooner. I am sure
				to lower her sedative during this time so she suffers as much as possible. She is thankful to have something to distract
				from the pain. I also keep her blindfolded and her ears plugged to start disconnecting her from her other senses. After
				she is healed, I can then remove her vocal chords and she has almost fully, physically, become a toy and the mental training
				can begin. </p>
			<a class="CPTAG"><img src="Images/body2.jpg" class="nudity pull-left pr" width="196"></a>
			<p> As I have grown my collection of my own dolls, I have changed how the girl is stored during her mental training of sexual
				abuse and confusion. I will now hang her from the ceiling along with the others and remove her blindfold and earplugs.
				It is important every girl understands what they are. I then attach a vibrator to her, choose one of my existing dolls,
				and begin using her while the new toys watch and are pleasured. This will eventually make the girl be aroused by what
				she is and not only be more obedient, but enjoy being your toy. She has become fully broken in, will be pleasured by
				pain, and obedient. </p>
			<p> Once she has finished her mental training and she has become not only a toy physically, but mentally, I perform the last
				steps so she will forever be your slave. </p>
			<p> As before, I deafen her by playing hours of extremely loud sounds multiple times a day but I have added the use of a vacuum
				tube, cupping the tube over her ears and rapidly changing pressure. She will be fully deaf with no chance of recovery.
				Previously, I would damage the girl's eyes with a laser. This still left my dolls with the ability to see light changes
				and shadows. It also left the eyes looking milky, <em class="PTAG"></em> damaged, and unattractive. </p>
			<p> To remove her eyesight, I have decided to fully remove the eyes. At this point, sedation is hardly necessary. The girls
				don't move and will let you do whatever you want to them. Before enucleation, instead of sedating the girl, I further
				distract them with sexual stimulation so that their final transition to becoming a doll is filled with immense pleasure
				and pain. Once her eyes are removed, I allow time to heal and create prosthetic eyes for her. I hand craft the eyes to
				each doll's remaining eye muscles and orbital contents so the eyes are in place forever and can still move! While removing
				the eyes, I stitch back the eyelid's excess skin that allows them to close. This keeps them naturally open. </p>
			<p> This all comes at a high price. Sadly, increased financial turmoil has caused many orphanages to shut down which have
				long been my usual supply of young girls. <a class="CFTAG">However</a>, I have grown tired of easily delivered and docile things. I have had
				to turn to other methods of procurement. I have found that girls plucked from a happy life make for much more satisfying
				and subservient dolls as well as a greater challenge which I have grown to love. The mental manipulation is much more
				damaging as they realize their lives are no longer theirs. This, and my new methods, bring a higher price tag to my dolls
				100,000.00 to 150,000.00 USD without shipping, but a living toy devoted to giving you satisfaction for as long as you
				please is a rare treat. </p>
