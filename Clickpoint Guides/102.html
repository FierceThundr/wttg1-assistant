			<h3 class="text-left text-orange strong">What Is Bug Chasing?</h3>
			<p class="text-left">Hard to believe you are here and don't know. But that's ok sweetie, we love first timers ;-) Bug chasing is a love of
				obtaining <a class="CPTAG">STDs</a>. It doesn't matter how many, which ones, just that we love having them and everything you do to get them.</p>
			<h3 class="text-left text-orange strong">Why would you want STDs?</h3>
			<p class="text-left">That answer is different for everyone. Some want to please the collector in them, some want the thrill of danger but,
				for many, it's <a class="CFTAG">freeing</a> to know you have nothing to lose and you have the sexual freedom to <a class="CPTAG">explore</a> anyone you want,
				anywhere you want. The danger is gone allowing you to fully explore your sexual needs and fantasies. It's fun :)</p>
			<h3 class="text-left text-orange strong">How does the site work?</h3>
			<p class="text-left">We are simply a community that shares our experiences and uses the group to arrange gifting sessions, orgies, or sexual
				encounters at home or traveling.</p>
			<h3 class="text-left text-orange strong">What if I'm shy?</h3>
			<p class="text-left">Oh baby, don't be worried. We have so many here that would love to show you what it's like but if you really want to experience
				the thrill without having the conversation, we <em class="PTAG"></em> sell all kinds of things on the store that will satisfy your needs.</p>
			<h3 class="text-left text-orange strong">Can I join if I'm not into Bug Chasing?</h3>
			<p class="text-left">No. To be in this <a class="CPTAG">community</a>, you have to actively be looking to give, or receive. We only want more like us here. You're
				request to join will be rejected if you cannot provide a good explanation as to why you want to be in the community.</p>
			<h3 class="text-left text-orange strong">How do I pay for things?</h3>
			<p class="text-left">We only accept DOScoins as the preferred cryptocurrency and you will need your wallet ID. Any <a class="CFTAG">transactions</a> between members
				on the forums are between those members in their own way, though most use an escrow service.</p>
