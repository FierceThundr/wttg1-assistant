			<p> You have found us though we are not hard to find. We are those who come from the earth. We are minerals who shall live
				long past your life time. Though we may be underfoot, do not misunderstand us! We are rocks and we are sturdy. We will
				withstand any pressures. </p>
			<p> Though we make break. We are one whole. Some of us may deteriorate and erode to sand so we may be spread across the world.
				But we do not fear! We may slumber in solitude for many life times but we may one day again become whole as new minerals
				are formed from our scattered existence. We are constant, we are sound, we are sturdy. We are rocks. </p>
			<p> Rocks are not interested in the matters of humanity or any living being for that matter. We will persist long into this
				world. You may grind us into dust to be used for <em class="PTAG"></em> your monuments. We may be weights to cease the flight of papers from
				your work surfaces but in the end, we are always what we are. We are minerals. Beautiful when glistening wet. Captivatingly
				interesting when dry and porous. You dig within us for our precious resources but never forget we are all the same. All
				one. All individual. All dust. Everywhere. Do not misunderstand me! We do not eat. We do not sleep. We are the form of
				the worlds function. </p>
			<p> Standing on chaotic shores we are slammed upon our surfaces by the tidal forces of the sea. We slowly wear to the world.
				Below are some of the rock gatherings we find most erotic. </p>
			<p class="text-center">

				<a class="CFTAG"><img src="Images/rocks3.jpg" width="300"></a>
			</p>
			<p> Behold! Rocks of the most glorious! True minerals! Their angles, their curves. The most erotic of erosion! Piled high
				so that they may try to touch the stars only to be returned to the earth from the harsh winds of the heavens, the salt
				of the sea, the angry waves of Poseidon! But we care not! We have no dreams. We have no needs. We are mineral and we
				will not be more than we are or less. We are all grains of sand waiting to be separated or reborn from the breasts of
				our mother earth. </p>
			<p> All become rocks! All become minerals. You will die and your remains will return to dirt. One day, you too will be reborn
				as the rocks you once were. Do the words you read ring true to you!? If not! You are not one of us. </p>
			<p class="text-center">
			WeRocks@hg83tgfxkh9622ghkshdhal.ann </p>
			<p> Do not try and contact us. You will be ignored! We are minerals and can not write. </p>
