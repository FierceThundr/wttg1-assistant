		<h1>My <em class="PTAG"></em> playmates!</h1>
		<section>
			<p> I'm not a one kitty pup! Lots and lots of little poofs live with me and we all share and love each other! We play together,
				eat together, sleep together, and so much more. We have a lot of <a class="CPTAG">fun</a>! I want you to meet my beautiful girls. Don't get
				too jealous because you can be a part of it too if you want :D </p>
			<div>

				<p> This is Sharley! She is definitely the <a class="CFTAG">mommy</a> of the house but always is submissive to me. She knows her role. She isn't
					very playful but also does not fight back very often. She's always there when I want to play. </p>
			</div>

				<a class="CPTAG"><img src="Images/cat2.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250"></a>
				<p> Tammy is a new kitten! She's too young to start training and can't be in the playroom yet except to watch. I just had
					to have her though once I saw that little black tail. Se will grow into a gorgeous young lady! </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat3.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> My older kitten Rilley is starting to fill out and become a woman. She's still young but not too young! she can start
					training! I lead new kittens into the playroom <em class="PTAG"></em> with toys so they know we are going to have fun. Then we snuggle in the
					playroom and everyone starts to feel more <a class="CFTAG">comfortable</a>. I bring new kitties in to the playroom when I'm having fun with
					the other cats and eventually they fit right in! </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat4.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Mimi is a sassy girl. She's never really happy going into the playroom but she eventually gives in and has a great time!
					I think she still has issues with me being a dog which is understandable but I can tell she is into the idea once we
					really get into playing. She secretly likes it. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat5.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Shima is always lying about. She's never a very active kitty. I have to pick her up by the scruff of her neck to carry
					her around. She just lays there. I love all my <a class="CPTAG">ladies</a> and it's great that she doesn't mind a big strong dog dominating
					her but I just wish she would play! I'm a very active doggy that need lots of exercise. :'( </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat6.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Raspberry, on the other hand, is such a little explorer. Even when we're trying to sleep in bed she is always rummaging
					around in the covers which I LOVE! She always sticker her foofy little face into the most wonderful of places. She really
					is a joy! </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat7.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Rebecca is a true lady. She refuses to chase me around or climb on me. She also wont come play right away. She takes
					a lot of flattery before she will finally give in and have fun but her smooth velvet like fur is so soft and feels great
					against me! </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat8.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> This little lady is a fiery ball of fluff! Pommy was so sweet when I first got her but shortly after her training, she
					started to become aggressive. My cats are all treated with love but she needed to know that I was the alpha dog in this
					house. So I started dominating her more than the other cats and I would play with her alone in the playroom instead
					of with a few girls like usual. She is still feisty to this day but she actually plays with me now! It's so much fun.
					Doggies love a little playful fight! </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a class="CFTAG"><img src="Images/cat9.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250"></a>
				<p> Sandy &amp; Mandy are basically the same cat. They LOVE to be around each other always. When we play together, I love
					to be in the middle. They are both so smooth! </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat10.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Abby is one of my most submissive babies! Most cats will be scared when they see a dog but not Abby! She knew just what
					she was supposed to do and I love when she shows me her sexy white belly. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat11.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Cherry is not pleased with your presence! haha! She's always so serious. It's always right to business with her! Being
					direct is nice some times :) </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="Images/cat12.jpg" class="pull-left" width="250">
				<p> Berry hides ALL THE TIME! She's such a <em class="PTAG"></em> crazy kitty. She's always hiding from me when I want to play. I think she will
					always be surprised by a big, powerful, dog coming to find her. </p>
