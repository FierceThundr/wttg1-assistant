                <h1>ENTRY 1</h1>
                <p>Ordering out isn't as bad for you as they say it is. The sweetest young thing showed up to my door
                    the other night. I was only thinking that it would be a nice night to indulge in something salty.
                    Pizza, but as soon as I answered the door and saw just who it was delivering my food I had a
                    different sort of salty on the mind. Must say I'm proud of myself and my willpower. I didn't jump
                    the darling boy there.
                </p>
                <p>I decided to try and be subtle. He was working after all, but it's hard when the fantasy of being
                    able to tear into the delivery boy like so many porno's promise was right at my fingertips. I
                    slipped him a $50 and a note with my number. The note might have been explicit but I think what
                    made him go tomato red was the sultry reminder to "enjoy himself" with that generous tip.
                </p>
                <p>It's so adorable to see how flustered they get from attention like that. Makes me want to tear
                    their clothes off and see how low that flush goes.
                </p>

                    You lovely readers remember Delivery Boy from the other night yes? I was starting to lose hope.
                    Some young men don't know what to do when a lady with confidence approaches him. Or leaves a note
                    detailing how she'd like to peg him. Thankfully he wasn't deterred. He came through. He also came
                    multiple times in multiple places. <em class="PTAG"></em> Young men with their stamina are god's greatest gift don't you
                    think?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm getting ahead of myself. You see we started with texts:
                </p>
                <p><img width="346" height="611"></p>
                <p>I'm not the type to kiss and tell - or show I guess but he had some gorgeous pictures to share.
                    They're going straight into my collection. He's barely out of college, such a sweet young thing
                    just begging to be taken care of and I plan to.

                <h1>ENTRY 3</h1>
                <p>DB (delivery boy for those not paying attention) has been staying with me these past few days. Boys
                    and their egos can be cute but sometimes it can be a setback. He has a baby face which is
                    undeniably a turn on especially when he talks so dirty as to make me wonder if he's as innocent as
                    he looks. It turns out he is, almost. DB was no <a class="CPTAG">virgin</a>, but he had never taken anything like he had
                    claimed. Never received, only given.
                </p>
                <p>Little DB was the most vanilla thing I've met in months. It was endearing to see how he shook and
                    shivered when the ropes were introduced. Popping that cherry is so satisfying. To watch them come
                    to terms with what they're feeling - to adjust and adapt and then beg for it. Once they realize
                    they crave dark pleasure like this they'll never be able to go back.
                </p>
                <p>Which is something I warned DB of when I was prepping him. He is such an eager puppy though. I'll
                    give him all the loving and attention he needs for the next week or so before I start weaning him
                    off. DB has potential but I want one I can work from the ground up - a virgin.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
                <h1>ENTRY 4</h1>
                <p>Sorry to have kept you all waiting. I know, it's been a while. DB has been keeping me busy. He is a
                    faster learner than I gave him credit for, but he had to be reminded as to who is in charge here.
                    The dear is currently 'tied up'. I'll check on him in an hour or two once he's been left wanting
                    for long enough. Technology is wonderful, isn't it?
                </p>
                <p>I can sit here, typing about how he's being drilled by something inanimate and controlled via a
                    remote I have here.
                </p>
                <p>I'm being too flowery aren't I? He's being fucked as I type this with a dildo. After a few hours he
                    should have learned his lesson. <a class="CFTAG">Maybe</a> I'll even let him come. I've been thinking about introducing
                    another man into the mix. There was this adorable one at the park walking his dog. We happened to
                    'bump' into each other. Mmm yes I think that might be the change DB needs.
                </p>

                <h1>ENTRY 5</h1>
                <p>Days are flying by in a blur! I'm neglecting you dear readers aren't I? Well you see I've found
                    myself another wonderful young man. You <a class="CPTAG">remember</a> the dog walker I mentioned before? We've spent the
                    better part of these last few days fucking each other to complete bliss while DB, the darling, was
                    forced to watch. I'd daresay he's learned about the error of his ways and won't be acting out again
                    anytime soon.
                </p>
                <p>The dog walker who I'll call Park, since that's where we met, has been nothing short of a dream. So
                    raw, so unhindered in his <a class="CPTAG">ecstasy</a> and responses. He is so eager to take everything I give, mmm. It
                    didn't take hardly any convincing to have him take DB under his 'wing'. Teach him. Give me
                    something to enjoy while I sit and <em class="PTAG"></em> relax, typing this very entry.
                </p>
                <p>What's even sweeter is that Park has a friend, one who is "curious" about what I could offer.</p>
                <p>I always did want my own harem.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry">
                <h1>ENTRY 6</h1>
                <p>Dear, dear readers. Park's friend was more than I imagined he could be. Early twenties and still a
                    virgin? I just had to take a week to properly introduce him into my home and our 'lifestyle'.
                    Spread him open and treat him to <a class="CFTAG">sensations</a> he could never have imagined even with all his porn and
                    fantasies. Nothing beats reality which he has come to understand intimately.
                </p>
                <p>The three of them are perfect in their own way. I'm content with them. Maybe I'll find another in
                    the future but for now, oh there's still so much to introduce to our new baby bird. He's nowhere
                    near ready to fly but with enough attention from myself and Park...mm sorry had to stop and shake
                    myself out of it. Thinking about what we've done is enough to get my heart racing and legs rubbing.
                </p>
                <p>Readers, I hear them calling for me.</p>
                <p>I'm sure you can <a class="CFTAG">make</a> do without me for a spell?</p>
