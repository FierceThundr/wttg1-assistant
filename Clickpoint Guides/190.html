		<p>Rape is all about timing and opportunity, which comes with an extremely high risk to your safety and wellbeing. We offer
				the ability to eliminate all the risks making it easy, safe, and (most importantly) guaranteed.</p>
		<p>Our mental health facility has a very large patient base who <em class="PTAG"></em> are not able to report you or their claims will simply
				not be believed. That is <a class="CPTAG">assuming</a> they manage to report abuse to a member of staff that is not associated with us (which,
				at this point, are very few) For over a <a class="CFTAG">decade</a> now, we have been providing this service incident free and have only
				become more polished in our process and have churned out potential problem staff.</p>
		<p>As time goes on, if a patient even is the sort to report being raped, their file will reflect it as one of their symptoms
				but many patients wont even be aware of what's <a class="CFTAG">happening</a> to them. Your safety is secured with us.</p>
		<p>We have grown our network to most states within the U.S. so it is very easy to setup an encounter. All you need to do
				is select your <a class="CFTAG">location</a>, describe your desired sex <a class="CPTAG">partner</a> (male/female, conscious, unconscious, fighter, docile, etc.)
				and we will setup a time and place for <em class="PTAG"></em> you to have your moment.</p>
		<p>Take the risk out of rape while still filling that urge. Contact us and we can get things moving for you <a class="CPTAG">immediately</a>!</p>
