			<div class="question">- How does this work?</div>
			<div class="answer">Our <a class="CFTAG">process</a> is very simple: You select your <a class="CPTAG">location</a> and preferred partner type. We send you the 
				information for location, time, and room number. Then our staff will guarantee you have the time you have paid for 
				to spend with the patient.</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="question">- How much does it cost?</div>
			<div class="answer">We charge $500 for every thirty minutes of use.</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="question"><em class="PTAG"></em> - Can I do whatever I want to them?</div>
			<div class="answer">Within reason. We don't want any damage that would be questioned during inspection. Basically, if you leave a 
				visible mark outside the clothes that cannot be <a class="CPTAG">explained</a>, you aren't allowed to do it. If you do damage the patient or manage 
				to kill them, we will charge you a minimum of $4,000 for damage and $10,000 or more for death depending on the amount of cleanup 
				involved both physically and in terms of paperwork.</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="question">- Are they going to remember?</div>
			<div class="answer">t's safe to assume they wont. Most of our patients are unfit to comprehend the event or in a coma. We do have more 
				lucid patients which you may be paired with if you <a class="CFTAG">want</a> certain things like pleading or fighting back. However, we have tailored 
				their file to include false rape accusations and other abuse as self <em class="PTAG"></em> inflicted to cover any suspicion. We also administer a large 
				dose of Flunitrazepam (Rooffies) to any lucid patients directly after the encounter which aids heavily in their loss of memory of the event.</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="question">- Is this safe for me?</div>
			<div class="answer">We have worked for many years perfecting our system. Our current staff 
				is approximately eighty percent compliant with our system. The other twenty percent are 
				staff that are rarely on site or do not <a class="CFTAG">often</a> have direct interaction with the patients. 
				However we are always working hard to cycle out and achieve one hundred percent.</div>
		</p>
		<p>Our orderlies will be near to be sure you aren't interrupted, our nurses make rounds to <a class="CPTAG">prevent</a> potential mix ups and our doctors provide 
			any medical treatment if need be. We also have STD information on file for every patient that comes in and access to further testing on 
			all patients so they are clean. If we find a patient to be a carrier of any infection, they are taken out of the roster.
