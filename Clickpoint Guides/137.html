					long, the entire foot reminds me of a stalk of celery. But the feet are so wonderfully thin I can only imagine they
					are attached to a slender little woman. The proportions drive me crazy and the beautiful <em class="PTAG"></em> blue shows she's clean and

					after is just sex. Just looking at the milky little toes poking out of the warmers teases me so badly! I want to lift
					the fabric and get a glimpse of everything else! <a class="CFTAG">BUT</a> seeing it all would not be anywhere near as fun as wondering. I
					would be in ecstasy with these caressing my face and maybe other things. :D

					Not perfectly symmetrical <em class="PTAG"></em> which gives a unique and beautiful finger print. I love the angle because I can stare at them
					and imagine they are mine. I just want to lean down and rub them. Run my fingers along the curves of each toe. There
					is no dancing around it. This picture just cuts right to what I want. I could <a class="CPTAG">rest</a> my cheek against these for hours.
