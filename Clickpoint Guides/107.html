		<h1 class="pbs">FREEZING FOR <a class="CFTAG">DISPOSAL</a></h1>
		<p class="pbs"> Freezing is an interesting method. I am a fan of it as a supplement because you could throw the body just about anywhere
			and have some safety and if you combine it with the burial method or any other method where the body could be found, it
			grants an extra layer of safety. I <a class="CFTAG">freeze</a> all my bodies if I am not going to corrode them. The reason is simple: if you
			freeze the body shortly after they have died, forensics can not tell when the individual was killed. The decay process
			slows down just like any <em class="PTAG"></em> meat you put in the freezer and, when thawed, the process takes a while to get going again. It
			will be obvious the body has been frozen but that dovesn't matter. They have no timeline as to the exact time of death.
			</p>
		<p class="pbs"> The drawback is that you need a large freezer, or you need to dismember the <a class="CFTAG">body</a>. I only dismember bodies if I am corroding
			in acid as I already have a clean setup. Any other time, there is too much risk of evidence. I suggest purchasing a large
			chest freezer. </p>
		<p class="pbs"> I would also suggest that the body be bathed in bleach to remove any DNA evidence any time you are leaving an actual body
			somewhere. There is no <em class="PTAG"></em> rule for freezing, it's simply to slow the decay process so you can dispose of the body whenever
			you like. I usually <a class="CFTAG">wait</a> several weeks if there is little attention to the missing <a class="CPTAG">person</a>. </p>
		<p> I recommend driving some place far and using the burial method I have outlined here or placing the body in a container,
			fill it with cement, and tossing it into a deep body of water. </p>
