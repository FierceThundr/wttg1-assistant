			<h1 class="strong"> WHAT <em class="PTAG"></em> I DO </h1>
			<a class="CPTAG"><img src="Images/jar2.jpg" class="pull-right pl" width="200"></a>
			<p> I specialize in the dismemberment and preservation of dead tissue. We have all lost loved ones and it can be very difficult
				but their memory doesn't have to die with them. I till take any body part or even an entire body and preserve it in formaldehyde
				for you then send it back so you will always have something to remember them by. It doesn't matter if it's your child,
				grand parent, pet, or anything else. I will preserve <a class="CFTAG">whatever</a> you want. My services include obtaining an appropriate
				container for the piece you want preserved, dismemberment if needed, the actual process of preservation, and return shipment.
				</p>
			<p> I have no problem keeping the remains if you simply want to send everything to me, receive your keepsake, and move on.
				I will do what I like with the remains so you don't have to handle the burden of disposal. You don't have to let go.
				I can help you keep a part of them with you always. </p>

			<h1 class="strong"> WHO I AM </h1>
			<p> I have had a long career in preservation working at an impressive list of various academies as a technician whose duties
				focused around the skinning of animals, their dismemberment, preservation, and documentation. I left my career when my
				interest in dismemberment and preservation fell out of line with my professional life. Shortly after, the European Union
				banned the us of formaldehyde. I then <a class="CPTAG">relocated</a> to a more relaxed area to continue my passion. I have a large collection
				of my own preserved specimens so I understand what it meant to want to have a piece of something once living in your
				home. </p>

			<h1 class="strong"> THE PROCESS </h1>
			<a class="CFTAG"><img src="Images/formjar.png" class="pull-left pr" width="122"></a>
			<p> There are other methods to preservation than formaldehyde but it is for aesthetic reasons that I choose to work with it.
				The soft colors that form over time as the red hue leaves the body creates a peaceful, ghostly quality that I feel captures
				the beauty of preservation. Using formaldehyde, the process is rather simple. I obtain an appropriate container for the
				specimen. I will use a certain size or type if you have a specific request and I can locate it. Then the process can
				begin. </p>
			<p> First, I wash the piece with a disinfectant solution then massage the muscles to relieve rigor mortis. I will remove bodily
				fluids and replace them with formaldehyde. Then, I will <em class="PTAG"></em> puncture and drain any and all organs of liquids and gas and
				replace their contents with formaldehyde. The piece is then soaked in a number of baths with increasing alcohol content
				over a few days. </p>
			<p> Finally, I fill the container with an isopropyl mixture and submerge your keepsake within it. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1 class="strong"> SHIPMENT </h1>
			<p> First, you will need to freeze your specimen immediately within the first few days. A rotten specimen can not be preserved.
				I will send a container large enough for your requested preservation along with dry ice packing. Pack your specimen and
				send back to me with the included shipping labels. Speed is very <a class="CPTAG">important</a> so I have all my deliveries rushed. If you
				take too long and the specimen is rotting, I will not refund the down payment as it is my costs for shipping and I will
				keep the specimen you send unless there is a further request and payment to return. </p>
			<p> I do any dismemberment prep that is needed, perform the preservation process, and then send the piece back to you in a
				well secured container. </p>

			<h1 class="strong"> CONTACT </h1>
			<p> If you would like a keepsake of your own, remember, there is no size too small or large for me. I am happy to perform
				preservation on anything. My rates change depending on my current stock of <a class="CFTAG">equipment</a> and chemicals so email me to find
				out the current rates. I require a <em class="PTAG"></em> 20% down payment and then the other 80% upon completion. Please note that I take pictures
				and other documentation of all my projects. </p>
