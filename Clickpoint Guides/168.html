			<p>Are you in financial trouble? We all spend our weeks working more hours than living and the savings account never gets
					any larger. Not matter what, there is always more debt. Once you're behind on one payment, it <a class="CPTAG">snowballs</a> and you are
					struggling to keep your head above <em class="PTAG"></em> water. I know what you're going through.</p>
			<p>Ask yourself: Do I have a <a class="CFTAG">reason</a> to not improve my life? Spend more time at home. What reason do I have to keep carrying
					these financial burdens?</p>
			<p>If you can't come up with a good reason to keep yourself in debt. I have an opportunity for you...</p>
			<p>What if I told you that you could pay off all your debt, get money into your savings, and work less during the week?</p>
			<p>All you need to do for us is kill <a class="CPTAG">someone</a>. You <a class="CFTAG">wont</a> know anything about the target other than what is <a class="CPTAG">needed</a> to locate
					and confirm them. All of the information you need is provided for you. Simply follow your instructions carefully,
					kill them, then send us proof confirming the kill. That's it. Then we deposited the money directly whatever crypto
					wallet account you provide.</p>
			<p>Will you live a better <em class="PTAG"></em> <a class="CFTAG">life</a>?</p>
