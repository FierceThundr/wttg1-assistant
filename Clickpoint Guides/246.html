				me but I just need to know I can be what she wants you know? I just love her so fucking much. I have to masturbate like
				4 times a day because of her. She's driving me <a class="CFTAG">crazy</a>! </p>

				her. She didn't smile at me this time when she saw me though. I hope she's not mad at me... </p>

			<p class="content"> I think she changed up her routine. I'm starting to think she's avoiding me. I love her so much and if that bitch isn't
				even TRYING to get to know me now.... fuck. I want to get closer to her. I waited until she threw out some trash again
				and went through it. More bathroom stuff! I think if I know more about her I can find out why she's so mad. </p>
