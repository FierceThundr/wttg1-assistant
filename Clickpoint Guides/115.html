			<p class="text-left"> For a shit ton of money I will spy on a specific <a class="CPTAG">girl</a> for you near my area. I don't spy on guys because I'm not gay like
				that. Go somewhere else for that. If I happen to be <a class="CFTAG">traveling</a> with my drone to an area near you. I will get whatever
				footage I can of the girl when I'm there but that's a super long shot. Up to you if you want to pay me for that though.
				</p>
			<p class="text-left"> Get in <a class="CPTAG">touch</a> with me though and I will tell you the general area I'm located so you can do some online <a class="CPTAG">stalking</a> and find
				a girl you like or to find out if I will be near your area <em class="PTAG"></em> any time soon. If you don't care who the girl is I can try
				to catch them doing something specific, but that takes more time which means more <a class="CFTAG">money</a>. Hit me up if you want something.
