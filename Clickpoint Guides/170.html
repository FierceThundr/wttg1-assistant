			<p>Once you choose a target, apply through our email. Provide available time frames for the job and <a class="CPTAG">distance</a> you would be traveling. 
				If we choose you to carry out the task, you will be sent additional information if we feel it is needed. You will not be told 
				why these targets have <a class="CFTAG">been</a> chosen. The less you know, the better for everyone.</p>
			<p>It is very important to monitor your target once you have located them. If you kill the wrong person, you receive no payment and 
				we will no longer hold any <a class="CPTAG">communications</a> with you. If you do not follow the kill notes associated with the targets, you will 
				receive no payment and we will no longer <a class="CFTAG">consider</a> you for future targets. We are not responsible for any <a class="CPTAG">repercussions</a> you may 
				encounter due to your actions including interaction <em class="PTAG"></em> through this site. Simply put, do the job well.</p>
			<p>In order to receive your payment, you need to prove you were the one to kill the target. Take a picture, send it to us, along 
				with the time, date and method <a class="CFTAG">used</a> and a detail that won't be released to the media right away. We will then send payment 
				to your specified account. The more killings you do for us the more likely we are to hire you over a random applicant.</p>
