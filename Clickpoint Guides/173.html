		<p> Welcome! Have you ever <a class="CPTAG">wanted</a> to be someone else? Feel what it's like to be inside someone else's <em class="PTAG"></em> skin? So have I and I
			have found a way to do it. Our faces are <a class="CFTAG">fingerprints</a> for the eye. I want to provide you with as many fingerprints as
			you like. </p>
		<p> When you feel my masks slide on to your skin you will feel instantly transformed! You will feel every feeling and emotion
			of what it must be like to be another human <em class="PTAG"></em> being. I wore my latest <a class="CPTAG">mask</a> this evening and she was a very intenerating
			woman by the name of <a class="CFTAG">Angelica</a>. We spent the evening together just chatting over wine and it was the most wonderful time.
			Don't you want the same thing? </p>

			<p> This is Angelica on her stand. I think she came out rather well. <a class="CPTAG">Removal</a> was not as bad as it usually is which let me
				get to the rest of the process <em class="PTAG"></em> rather quickly. I'm actually rather fond of her so I'm not certain I want to sell her
				just yet. Maybe we can spend a few more moments together and I can decide if she is someone I want to keep in my life.
				</p>
			<p> I have many masks in <a class="CFTAG">addition</a> to Angelica though. All are for sale. If you would like to become someone else with as fresh
				a face as possible. Please contact me. </p>
